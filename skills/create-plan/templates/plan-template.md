# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview
[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis
[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State
[Specification of desired end state and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:
- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## What We're NOT Doing
[Explicitly list out-of-scope items]

## Implementation Approach
[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1. [Component/File Group]
**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary]

```[language]
// Specific code to add/modify
```

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `make typecheck`
- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`
- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Feature works as expected in UI
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
- [ ] Edge case handling verified
- [ ] No regressions in related features

**Implementation Note**: After automated verification passes, pause for manual confirmation before next phase.
